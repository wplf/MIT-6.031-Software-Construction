# 09-Avoiding Debugging

- Avoid debugging
  - make bugs impossible with techniques like static typing, automatic dynamic checking, and immutability
- Keep bugs confined
  - failing fast with assertions keeps a bugâ€™s effects from spreading
  - incremental development and unit testing confine bugs to your recent code
  - scope minimization reduces the amount of the program you have to search
